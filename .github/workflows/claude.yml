    # you might want to adjust or remove `github.actor == github.repository_owner`.
    # For example, to allow any user with write access: `github.event.comment.author_association == 'COLLABORATOR' || github.event.comment.author_association == 'OWNER'`
    # Ensure you understand the security implications before changing this.
